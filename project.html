            <h3>
My full name is Abdulrahman. Which translated into english means, the slave of the most merciful.
<br>
However, since this is a native arabic name, your average "joe" is unable to pronounce it.
<br>
So they end up calling me, "Abdul". Which I hate. But I have grown to live with.
<br>
Before we begin with anything else, let us listen to Surah Alaq by Sheikh Muhammad Siddiq
<br>
Al Minshawi, may Allah have mercy on him. I muted it just in case you need to get ready.
<br>
Unmute whenever you're ready, and lower the volume first.

Im born in Canada , 
but my parents are from Iraq.
So I guess by no way of actually 
earning the nationality, you could
call me Iraqi. 
<br>
You might be wondering why the background is this colour,
That's because I like forest green, and so I chose it as it is also easy
on the eyes.
<br>
Here is a flag of the country of Iraq. In the middle of it written in green 
is "Allah is greater". Most people say "Allahu-akbar" means god is great.
This is an incorrect translation. "Allah" means God. "Akbar" means greater.
Put together, you get "Allah is greater".

During high school, I didn't 
really know what to study. 
I was all over the place with
wanting to become a pilot,
engineer, biologist, even a nurse.
Finally, I settled on studying I.T.
How the heck did you go from nursing to I.T?
I have no idea.

So I picked the closest University to me,
York University. Little did I know,
York university has a track record with strikes.
They can't go a year without going on strike.

So now, I have only 1 course to attend weekly, 
whilst all the others are on pause because TAs 
feel like they're not being paid enough.
So instead of working harder, or finding another job,
they just go on strike. Or as I like to call it, 
"do anything but work harder." They also have
the audacity to block people from entering the 
school to "demonstrate" themselves "striking".

Now if York University issued refunds for students,
who lost out on valuable learning time, and money,
I would at least say, "hey, at least they're issuing a refund."
However, York does not issue refunds, instead, they give
course credits to take the course at another time.
Whos to say they won't have another strike?

Nevertheless, everything is in god's hands. 
I depend on him, and he is my protector. 
He is one god, none is worthy of worship but he alone.
I end off here, again all praise and gratitude is due to him,
Allah alone. I seek Allah's forgiveness for any shortcomings. 
I send blessings and salutations upon his final prophet and messenger.
